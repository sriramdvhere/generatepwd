# generatepwd

A simple Python CLI tool for generating secure passwords with customizable length and complexity.

## Features

- Supports three complexity levels:
  - **SIMPLE**: Lowercase letters only
  - **MEDIUM**: Mixed uppercase and lowercase letters
  - **HIGH**: Mixed letters, digits, and special characters
- Input validation for length (integer between 1 and 100) and complexity
- Colored CLI output for success and error messages using `click`

## Installation

- Install using pip command

```bash
pip install generatepwd
```

## Usage

- Run the CLI with default options (default length - 12, default complexity - SIMPLE):

```bash
generatepwd
```

Or use the `generatepwd`:

```bash
generatepwd -l 16 -c HIGH
```

Options:

- `-l`, `--length`: Password length (default: 12)
- `-c`, `--complexity`: Complexity level (`SIMPLE`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, default: `SIMPLE`)

Example:

```bash
generatepwd -l 20 -c medium
# Output: Generated Password: fRLsSiPlnYaNtgpMfPQY
```
