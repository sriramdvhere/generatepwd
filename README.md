# genpass

A simple Python CLI tool for generating secure passwords with customizable length and complexity.

## Features

- Supports three complexity levels:
  - **SIMPLE**: Lowercase letters only
  - **MEDIUM**: Mixed uppercase and lowercase letters
  - **HIGH**: Mixed letters, digits, and special characters
- Input validation for length (integer between 1 and 100) and complexity
- Colored CLI output for success and error messages using `click`
- Modular design with strategies, validators, and distribution calculator

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genpass.git
   cd genpass
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Install as an editable package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

- Run the CLI with default options (entry point is `cli.py`):

```bash
python -m generatepwd.cli
```

Or use the `generatepwd` entry point (if installed):

```bash
generatepwd -l 16 -c HIGH
```

Options:

- `-l`, `--length`: Password length (default: 12)
- `-c`, `--complexity`: Complexity level (`SIMPLE`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, default: `SIMPLE`)

Example:

```bash
generatepwd -l 20 -c medium
# Output: Generated Password: fRLsSiPlnYaNtgpMfPQY
```
